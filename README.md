# Random colocalization

This macro can be used to calculate random colocalization. It will create random points in a binary image, create a circular ROI from this and  measure the colocalization with the objects of interest (value = 255) in the image. 

The user can set the number of repeats, the number of points randomly placed in the image, the radius of the dot and the minimal required percentage of the dot that has to overlap with the thresholded area in the image.
